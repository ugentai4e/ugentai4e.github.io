  abstract        = {The evolution towards the emerging Active Distribution Networks (ADNs) can be realized via a Real-Time State Estimation (RTSE) application facilitated by the use of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). A critical challenge in PMU-based RTSE is the lack of a scalable and flexible communication infrastructure for the timely (i.e., sub-second) delivery of the high volume of synchronized and continuous synchrophasor measurements. We address this challenge by introducing a communication platform called C-DAX based on the information-centric networking (ICN) concept. With a topic-based publish-subscribe engine that decouples data producers and consumers in time and space, C-DAX enables efficient synchrophasor measurement delivery as well as flexible and scalable (re)configuration of PMU data communication for seamless full observability of power conditions in complex and dynamic scenarios. Based on the derived set of requirements for supporting PMU-based RTSE in ADNs, we design the ICN-based C-DAX communication platform, together with a joint optimized physical network resource provisioning strategy in order to enable the agile PMU data communications in near real-time. In this paper, C-DAX is validated via a prototype implementation deployed over a sample feeder as a proof-of-concept and evaluated through simulation-based experiments using a large set of real medium voltage grid topologies operating in the Netherlands.},

We outline the applications that benefit from analyzing this data (ranging from customer segmentation to operational system planning), and propose two-stage load pattern clustering. The first stage is performed per individual user and identifies the various typical daily power usage patterns (s)he exhibits. The second stage takes those typical user patterns as input, to group users that are similar. To improve scalability, we use fast wavelet transformation (FWT) of the time series data, which reduces the dimensionality of the feature space where the clustering algorithm operates in (i.e., from N data points in the time domain to log N). Another qualitative benefit of FWT is that patterns that are identical in shape but just differ in a (typically small) time shift still end up in the same cluster. Furthermore, we use g-means instead of k-means as the clustering algorithm. Our comprehensive set of experiments to analyzes the impact of using FWT vs. time-domain features, and g-means vs. k-means, to conclude that in terms of cluster quality metrics our system is comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while being more scalable (because of the dimensionality reduction).},

  abstract        = {Challenges that smart grids aim to address include the increasing fraction of supply by renewable energy sources, as well as plain rise of demand, e.g., by increased electrification of transportation. Part of the solution to these challenges lies in exploiting the opportunity to steer residential electricity consumption (e.g., for flattening the peak load or balancing the supply and demand in presence of the renewable energy production). To optimally exploit this opportunity, it is crucial to have insights on how flexible the residential demand is. Load flexibility is characterized by the amount of power, time of availability and duration of deferrable consumption. Residential flexibility however, is challenging to exploit due to the variation in types of customer loads and differences in appliance usage habits from one household to the other. Existing analyses of individual customer flexibility behavior in terms of timing are often based on inferences from surveys or customer load patterns (e.g., as observed through smart meter data): there is a high level of uncertainty about customer habits in offering the flexibility. Even though some of these studies rely on real world data, only few of them have quantitative data on actual flexible appliance usage, and none of them characterizes individual user behavior. In this paper, we address this gap and contribute with: (1) a new quantitative specification of flexibility, (2) two systematic methodologies for modeling individual customer behavior, (3) evaluation of the proposed models in terms of how accurately the data they generate corresponds with real world customer behavior, and (4) a basic analysis of factors influencing the flexibility behavior based on statistical tests. Experimental results for (2)–(4) are based on a unique dataset from a real-life field trial.},

  abstract        = {A basic but crucial step to increase e ciency and save energy in residential settings, is to have an accurate view of energy consumption. To monitor residential energy consumption cost-effectively, i.e., without relying on per-device monitoring equipment, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) provides an elegant solution. The aim of NILM is to disaggregate the total power consumption (as measured, e.g., by smart meters at the grid connection point of the household) into individual devices’ power consumption, using machine learning techniques. An essential building block of NILM is event detection: the detection of when appliances are switched on or off. Current state-of-the-art methods face two open issues. First, they are typically not robust to differences in base load power consumption and secondly, they require extensive parameter optimiza- tion. In this paper, we address both problems. We start by proposing two novel and robust algorithms, a modified version of the chi-squared goodness-of-fit (X2 GOF) test and an event detection method based on cepstrum smoothing. Then, we introduce a workflow using surrogate-based optimization (SBO) to efficiently tune these methods. By benchmarking on the BLUED dataset, we show that both suggested algorithms outperform the standard X2 GOF test for traces with a higher base load and can be optimized efficiently using SBO.},

A systematic comparison and combination of the available features in terms of their effectiveness is still missing. This paper, as its first contribution, offers a concise and updated review of the features reported in literature for the purpose of load identification. As a second contribution, a systematic feature elimination process is proposed to identify the most effective feature set. The analysis is validated on a large benchmark dataset and shows that the proposed feature elimination process improves the appliance classification accuracy for all the appliances in the dataset compared to using all thefeatures or randomly chosen subsets of features.},

Our contributions include: (1) characterization of the EV charging behavior by clustering the arrival and departure time combinations (leading to the identification of type of EV charging behavior), (2) in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the charging sessions in each behavioral cluster and investigation of the influence of weekdays and seasonal changes on those characteristics including arrival, sojourn and idle times, and (3) proposing measures and an algorithm to quantitatively analyze how much flexibility (in terms of duration and amount) is used at various times of a day, for two representative scenarios.

This paper proposes a method capable of detecting previously unidentified appliances in an automated way. For this, appliances represented by their VI trajectory are mapped to a newly learned feature space created by a siamese neural network such that samples of the same appliance form tight clusters. Then, clustering is performed by DBSCAN allowing the method to assign appliance samples to clusters or label them as ‘unidentified’. Benchmarking on PLAID and WHITED shows that an F1 macro-measure of respectively 0.90 and 0.85 can be obtained for classifying the unidentified appliances as ‘unidentified’.},

We investigate whether it is possible to cost-effectively employ 100\% renewable energy sources (RES) including battery energy storage systems (BESS) for producing electricity to meet cities' loads. We further analyze the potential to use only RES to meet partial loads, e.g., by meeting load demands only for certain fractions of the time. We present a novel flexible-load methodology and investigate the cost reduction achieved by shifting fractions of load across time. We use it to evaluate the impacts of exploiting exibility on making a 100\% RES scenario cost effective. For instance, in a case study for Kortrijk, a typical Belgian city with around 75,000 inhabitants, we find that from a purely economic viewpoint, RES-BESS systems are not cost effective even with flexible loads: RES-BESS costs must decrease to around 40\% and 7\% (around 0.044 EUR/kWh and 0.038 EUR/kWh), respectively, of the reference levelized costs of electricity to cost-effectively supply the city's load demand. These results suggest that electricity alone may not lead to high penetration of RES, and integration between electricity, heat, transport and other sectors is crucial.},

Current literature estimates the pa- rameters of these mixture models using the expectation-maximization method, but we will show that this exhibits a few shortcomings for the considered mixture model. First, standard expectation-maximization does not guarantee convergence to a global optimum, because the likelihood is multi-modal, which results from the high dimensionality of the mixture’s likelihood. Second, given that expectation-maximization provides point estimates of the parameters only, the uncertainties of the estimates (e.g., confidence intervals) are not directly available in these methods. Hence, extra calculations are needed to quantify such uncertainty. We propose a Metropolis-Hastings based algorithm that avoids both shortcomings of expectation-maximization. Indeed, Metropolis-Hastings provides an ap- proximation to the complete (posterior) distribution, given that it samples from the joint posterior of the mixture parameters. This facilitates direct inference (e.g., about uncertainty, multi-modality) from the estimation. In de- veloping the algorithm, we tackle various challenges including convergence speed, label switching and selecting the optimum number of mixture components. We then (i) verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on sample datasets with known true parameters, and further (ii) validate our methodology on an environmental dataset (a traditional application domain of Abe-Ley mixtures where measurements are function of direction). Finally, we (iii) demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in an application domain where the circular measurement is periodic in time.},

In this paper, we consider a system comprising a medium-sized wind turbine, a high power battery and an industrial load, connected to a distribution grid. Wind and load power were measured concurrently in real time at 1 s resolution for 2 months in summer 2017, at two locations in Belgium. We performed two simulations, one using the real time data at 1 s resolution and the other using the same power data averaged over 10 min intervals. We compared both simulations to calculate three metrics: total self-sufficiency error, battery utilization error and instantaneous self-sufficiency error. We repeated the analysis using different settings in terms of battery capacity, battery C rate limit and load ratio. We conclude that: (i) total self-sufficiency, in all cases, is overestimated, ranging between 0.06 and 3.6%, with errors decreasing for higher battery capacity, (ii) battery utilization is always underestimated with errors ranging between 7.5 and 44.7%, primarily depending on the C rate limit, and (iii) there is a clear correlation between instantaneous self-sufficiency error and instantaneous ratio of the averaged load and wind power, with errors exceeding 100% when the ratio ranges in 0.5–2.},

Initial DR studies mainly adopt model predictive control, but models are largely uncertain for the EV scenario (e.g., customer behavior).

We propose a new Markov decision process (MDP) formulation in the RL framework, to jointly coordinate a set of charging stations. State-of-the-art algorithms either focus on a single EV, or control an aggregate of EVs in multiple steps (e.g., (1) make aggregate load decisions, (2) translate the aggregate decision to individual EVs). In contrast, our RL approach jointly controls the whole set of EVs at once. We contribute a new MDP formulation with a scalable state representation independent of the number of charging stations. Using a batch RL algorithm, fitted Q-iteration, we learn an optimal charging policy. With simulations using real-world data, we (i) differentiate settings in training the RL policy (e.g., the time span covered by training data), (ii) compare its performance to an oracle all-knowing benchmark (providing an upper performance bound), (iii) analyze performance fluctuations throughout a full year, and (iv) demonstrate generalization capacity to larger sets of charging stations.},

In this paper, we investigate the potential of peak shaving through battery storage. The analyzed system comprises a battery, a load and the grid but no renewable energy sources. The study is based on 40 load profiles of low voltage users, located in Belgium, for the period 1 Jan 2014 00:00 – 31 Dec 2016 23:4h, at 15 min resolution, with peak demand pricing. For each user, we study the peak load reduction achievable by batteries of varying energy capacity (kWh), ranging from 0.1 to 10 times the mean power (kW). The results show that, for 75% of the users, the peak reduction stays below 44% when the battery capacity is 10 times the mean power. Furthermore, for 75% of the users the battery remains idle for at least 80% of the time; consequently, the battery could possibly provide other services as well if the peak occurrence is sufficiently predictable. From an economic perspective, peak shaving looks interesting for capacity invoiced end users in Belgium, under the current battery capex and electricity prices (without Time-of-Use (ToU) dependency).},

  abstract        = {Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations have become prominent in electricity grids in the past years. Their increased penetration introduces both challenges and opportunities; they contribute to increased load, but also offer flexibility potential, e.g., in deferring the load in time. To analyze such scenarios, realistic EV data is required, which is hard to come by. Therefore, in this article we define a synthetic data generator (SDG) for EV charging sessions based on a large real-world dataset. Arrival times of EVs are modeled assuming that the inter-arrival time of EVs follow an exponential distribution. Connection time for EVs is dependent on the arrival time of EV, and can be described using a conditional probability distribution. This distribution is estimated using Gaussian mixture models, and departure times can calculated by sampling connection times for EV arrivals from this distribution.  
Our SDG is based on a novel method for the temporal modeling of EV sessions, and jointly models the arrival and departure times of EVs for a large number of charging stations. Our SDG is trained using real-world EV sessions, and used to generate synthetic samples of session data, which are statistically indistinguishable from the real-world data. We provide both (i)source code to train SDG models from new data, and (ii) trained models that reflect real-world dataset.},

  abstract        = {Due to manufacturing defects and wear, faults in photovoltaic (PV) systems are often unavoidable. The effects range from energy losses to risk of fire and electrical shock, making early fault detection and identification crucial. Literature focuses on PV fault diagnosis using dedicated on-site sensors or high-frequency current and voltage measurements. Although these existing techniques are accurate, they are not economical for widespread adoption, leaving many PV systems unmonitored. In contrast, we introduce a machine learning based technique that relies on satellite weather data and low-frequency inverter measurements for accurate fault diagnosis of PV systems. This allows one to adopt machine learning based fault diagnosis even for PV systems without on-site sensors. The proposed approach relies on a recurrent neural network to identify six relevant types of faults, based on the past 24 hours of measurements, as opposed to only taking into account the most recent measurement. Additionally, whereas state-of-the-art methods are limited to identifying the fault type, our model also estimates the output power reduction stemming from the fault, i.e., the fault severity. Comprehensive experiments on a simulated PV system demonstrate that this approach is sensitive to faults with a severity as small as 5%, reaching an accuracy of 96.9% ± 1.3% using exact weather data and 86.4% ± 2.1% using satellite weather data. Finally, we show that the model generalizes well to climates other than the climate of its training data and that the model is also able to detect unknown faults, i.e., faults that were not represented in the training data},

Such flexibility refers to a systems ability to deviate from its scheduled energy consumption. Identifying the flexibility, and therefore, designing control that ensures efficient and reliable operation presents a great challenge due to the inherently complex dynamics of industrial systems. Recently, machine learning models have attracted attention for identifying flexibility, due to their ability to model complex nonlinear behavior. This research presents machine learning based methods that integrate system dynamics into the machine learning models (e.g., Neural Networks) for better adherence to physical constraints. We define and evaluate physics informed long-short term memory networks (PhyLSTM) and physics informed neural networks (PhyNN) for the identification of flexibility in the evaporative cooling process. These physics informed networks approximate the time-dependent relationship between control input and system response while enforcing the dynamics of the process in the neural network architecture. Our proposed PhyLSTM provides less than 2% system response estimation error, converges in less than half iterations compared to a baseline Neural Network (NN), and accurately estimates the defined flexibility metrics. We include a detailed analysis of the impact of training data size on the performance and optimization of our proposed models.},

To address these drawbacks, we propose a fault diagnosis model based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which monitors a group of PV systems by comparing their current and voltage production over the last 24 h. This methodology allows for monitoring PV systems without sensors, as hourly measurements of the produced current and voltage are obtained via the PV systems’ inverters. Comprehensive experiments are conducted by simulating 6 different PV systems in Colorado using 6 years of real weather measurements. Despite large variations in number of modules, module type, orientation, location, etc., the GNN can accurately detect and identify early occurrences of 6 common faults. Specifically, the GNN reaches 84.6% +/- 2.1% accuracy without weather data and 87.5% +/- 1.6% when satellite weather estimates are provided, significantly outperforming two state-of-the-art PV fault diagnosis models. Moreover, the results suggest that GNN can generalize to PV systems it was not trained on and retains high accuracy when multiple PV systems are simultaneously affected by faults.},

Proposing efficient bidding strategies for simultaneous participation in the energy and reserve market is challenging since it requires the integration of different market mechanisms in a single optimization problem (combining energy and reserve markets), as well as an accurate mathematical model of industrial processes from which to obtain energy flexibility. Often, such mathematical models are either not available or are described through complex simulators, making the design of a computationally efficient bidding strategy a complicated task. This paper introduces a novel framework to support energy-intensive industrial plants to offer energy flexibility in the joint energy and reserve market. We use a neural network to model the complex nonlinear dynamics of the industrial flexible process. Then, to reduce the complexity of the resulting optimization process we convert the neural network into linear constraints, formulating the problem of bidding energy flexibility into the electricity market as a mixed-integer linear program. The uncertainties of the process variables are considered using a scenario-based approach. A realistic simulation considering the case of an evaporative cooling tower used in the chemical industry, participating in the Belgian electricity market is carried out to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme.},

Here, we specifically focus on using a demand response (DR) algorithm to limit the energy consumption of a residential building's heating system while respecting user's thermal comfort. In that domain, Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been shown to be quite effective. One such RL method is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which has achieved impressive success in playing board games (go, chess). A particular advantage of MCTS is that its decision tree structure naturally allows to integrate exogenous constraints (e.g., by trimming branches that violate them), while conventional RL solutions need more elaborate techniques (e.g., indirectly by adding penalties in the cost/reward function, or through a backup controller that corrects constraint-violating actions). The main aim of this paper is to study the adoption of MCTS for building control, since this (to the best of our knowledge) has remained largely unexplored. A specific property of MCTS is that it needs a simulator component that can predict subsequent system states, based on actions taken. A straightforward data-driven solution is to use black-box neural networks (NNs). We will however extend a Physics-informed Neural Network (PiNN) model to deliver multi-timestep predictions, and show the benefit it offers in terms of lower prediction errors (−32% MAE) as well as better MCTS performance (−4% energy cost, +7% thermal comfort) compared to a black-box NN. A second contribution will be to extend a vanilla MCTS version to adopt the ideas applied in AlphaZero (i.e., using learned prior and value functions and an action selection heuristic) to obtain lower computational costs while maintaining control performance.},

To this end, we propose a battery control framework based on distributional reinforcement learning. Our proposed control framework takes a risk-sensitive perspective, allowing BRPs to adjust their risk preferences: we aim to optimize a weighted sum of the arbitrage profit and a risk measure (value-at-risk in this study) while constraining the daily number of cycles for the battery. We assess the performance of our proposed control framework using the Belgian imbalance prices of 2022 and compare two state-of-the-art RL methods, deep Q-learning and soft actor–critic (SAC). Results reveal that the distributional soft actor–critic method outperforms other methods. Moreover, we note that our fully risk-averse agent appropriately learns to hedge against the risk related to the unknown imbalance price by (dis)charging the battery only when the agent is more certain about the price.},

Due to decreasing and volatile wholesale electricity prices, the industrial partners/owners of the photovoltaic park are considering hydrogen storage in an attempt to increase the value proposition of their renewable energy installation. A major objective of the present work is to show how the utilization factor of the electrolyzer is affected by the design of the power supply system when the latter consists only of renewable energy sources instead of using the electric grid. Different hybrid designs were developed, by combining the existing photovoltaic source with wind power and state-of-the-art energy storage technologies (Vanadium Redox Flow or Lithium NMC). Finally, four scenarios were investigated, all considering a 1 MW PEM electrolyzer: A) 15 MW PV, B) 15 MW PV, 2MW Wind, C) 15 MW PV, 2 MW Wind, Battery, D) 15 MW PV, 15 MW Wind. The utilization factor was found as follows, for each scenario respectively: A) 41.5%, B) 65.5%, C) 66.0–86.0%, D) 82.0%. Furthermore, the analysis was extended to include economic evaluations (i.e., payback period, accumulated profit), specifically concerning scenario B and C. The results of this study lead to a number of conclusions such as: i) The utilization of the electrolyzer is limited when its power supply is intermittent. ii) Compared to PV, wind power makes larger contribution to the increase of the utilization factor, iii) 100% utilization can be achieved only if an energy storage system co-exists. iv) With a utilization factor at 65.5% scenario B can deliver a payback period in less than 8 years, if hydrogen is sold above 5€/kg.

We benchmark these two methods against each other, as well as to a baseline scenario of uncontrolled charging.

  abstract        = {Faults in photovoltaic (PV) systems due to manufacturing defects and normal wear and tear are practically unavoidable. The effects thereof range from minor energy losses to risk of fire and electrical shock. Thus, several PV fault diagnosis techniques have been developed, usually based on dedicated on-site sensors or high-frequency current and voltage measurements. Yet, implementing them is not economically viable for common small-scale residential systems. Hence, we focus on cost-effective techniques that enable introducing fault diagnosis without incurring costs for on-site sensor systems. In this chapter, we will present in particular two machine-learning-based approaches, built on recent neural network models. The first technique relies on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using satellite weather data and low-frequency inverter measurements for accurate fault detection, including severity estimation (i.e., the power loss caused by the fault, usually not quantified in state-of-the-art methods in literature). The second technique is based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which we use to monitor a group of PV systems by comparing their current and voltage production over the last 24 h. By comparing outputs from multiple (geographically nearby) PV installations, we avoid any need for additional sensor data. Moreover, our results suggest that the GNN-based model can generalize to PV systems it was not trained on (as long as nearby sites are available) and retains high accuracy when multiple PV systems are simultaneously affected by faults.},

  abstract        = {Smart Grid networks imply the overlaying of the power grid network with communication networks, to enable advanced coordination mechanisms. While the main drivers for Smart Grid projects might vary from region to region (e.g., increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy production in the European Union, need for enhanced reliability in the U.S.), the key differentiators of the next generation power grid stem from the massive amounts of data distributed throughout the grid, which must be used to optimally operate the grid. Thus, the basic functions that communication networks should provide can be summarized as: 1) data acquisition from a massive amount of measurement devices and 2) sending control signals to steer consumption/generation (e.g., demand-supply matching). The data acquisition part clearly involves gathering the smart meter data from the residential meters scattered across the distribution network. But it also implies collecting the information of so-called synchrophasors, generally known as phasor measurement units (PMUs), which are devices typically installed in the transmission network that combine precise measurements of currents and voltages with accurate time recording. Applications that can make use of these measurements (both in distribution and transmission networks) have varying requirements for real- time communications. Clearly, there is a need for (distributed) control mechanisms, which also imply specific network architectures.
An overlay network is a network built on the top of the underlying network. It relies on the infrastructure of the underlying network but only uses its basic services. Overlay networks themselves provide enhanced services optimized for the class of targeted applications. Smart Grid communications requires support of application-specific resource discovery, session control, routing, addressing, and other features in order to support services specifically designed for the Smart Grid operation. Smart Grid communications applications include data acquisition, operation of Smart Grid demand/response control mechanisms, synchrophasors, end-user energy management, etc.
Some overlay networks operators book infrastructure resources through service level agreements, and other overlay networks are designed to adapt to the environment and manage Quality of Experience to compensate for lack of Quality of Service. In this chapter, we discuss both of these types of overlay networks with emphasis on IP-based overlays that tend to use underlying infrastructure opportunistically, and do not rely on availability of adequate infrastructure resources.},

Like the original, PLAID 2 is a public dataset for load identification research consisting of short voltage and current measurements (a few seconds) for different appliances found in residential buildings in the United States. Besides increasing the number of appliance instances, this extension includes measurements made during different operating modes for many appliance types. Because of the imbalanced nature of these datasets, alternative metrics to adequately evaluate the performance of classification algorithms are suggested. In particular, the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve and its summary statistics lead to more consistent and meaningful results than accuracy or F1-measure. Additionally, the class imbalance can cause the classifier to only focus on the majority classes. The paper addresses methods handling this. However, it is found that these are unnecessary for the PLAID dataset.},

In this paper, we show that this assumption holds and that it is a viable approach in practice.

We benchmark these approaches on the aggregated data from the 2018 version of PLAID. We obtain, respectively for each of these classifiers, a maximal Fmacro-measure of 85.31% and 87.95%.

This paper proposes physics-informed neural networks-based grey-box modeling methods for the identification of energy buffers. The underlying system dynamics are enforced on the neural network structure to ensure that the identified grey-box model follows the approximate physics. We define two novel grey-box models based on simple and recurrent neural network architectures and test these models for a generic energy buffer. Performance and training time for the proposed grey-box models are compared against a black-box baseline model. Results confirm that imposing the dynamic system’s physics on the network improves the performance, and utilizing a recurrent architecture leads to a further improvement.},

Instead, the GNN compares 24 h of current and voltage measurements obtained from the inverters. Four GNN variants are experimentally compared using simulated data of six different PV systems in Colorado. Results show that all GNN variants outperform a state-of-the-art PV fault diagnosis method based on gradient boosted trees. Moreover, some GNN variants can even generalize to PV systems which were not in the training data, enabling monitoring of new PV systems without retraining.},

In contrast, in this paper, we focus on aggregated control of a set of residential buildings, to provide grid supporting services, that eventually should include ancillary services. In particular, we present a real-life pilot study that studies the effectiveness of reinforcement-learning (RL) in coordinating the power consumption of 8 residential buildings to jointly track a target power signal. Our RL approach relies solely on observed data from individual households and does not require any explicit building models or simulators, making it practical to implement and easy to scale. We show the feasibility of our proposed RL-based coordination strategy in a real-world setting. In a 4-week case study, we demonstrate a hierarchical control system, relying on an RL-based ranking system to select which households to activate flex assets from, and a real-time PI control-based power dispatch mechanism to control the selected assets. Our results demonstrate satisfactory power tracking, and the effectiveness of the RL-based ranks which are learnt in a purely data-driven manner.},

This has spurred the development of advanced control algorithms that maximally achieve those goals. However, a common challenge faced while developing such controllers is the unavailability of accurate forecasts of household power consumption, especially for shorter time resolutions (15 minutes) and in a data-efficient manner. In this paper, we analyze how transfer learning can help by exploiting data from multiple households to improve a single house's load forecasting. Specifically, we train an advanced forecasting model (a temporal fusion transformer) using data from multiple different households, and then finetune this global model on a new household with limited data (i.e., only a few days). The obtained models are used for forecasting power consumption of the household for the next 24 hours~(day-ahead) at a time resolution of 15 minutes, with the intention of using these forecasts in advanced controllers such as Model Predictive Control. We show the benefit of this transfer learning setup versus solely using the individual new household's data, both in terms of (i) forecasting accuracy (~15% MAE reduction) and (ii) control performance (~2% energy cost reduction), using real-world household data.},

Besides traditional sources, the residential sector is another major and largely untapped source of flexibility, driven by the increased adoption of solar PV, home batteries, and EVs. However, unlocking this residential flexibility is challenging as it requires a control framework that can effectively manage household energy consumption, and maintain user comfort while being readily scalable across different, diverse houses. We aim to address this challenging problem and introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach using differentiable decision trees. This approach integrates the scalability of data-driven reinforcement learning with the explainability of (differentiable) decision trees. This leads to a controller that can be easily adapted across different houses and provides a simple control policy that can be explained to end-users, further improving user acceptance. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze our method using a home energy management problem, comparing its performance with commercially available rule-based baseline and standard neural network-based RL controllers. Through this preliminary study, we show that the performance of our proposed method is comparable to standard RL-based controllers, outperforming baseline controllers by ~20% in terms of daily cost savings while being straightforward to explain.},

To tackle this, we analyze the participation of grid-scale batteries in Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control strategy. Acting in a multi-market scenario, the RL agent learns to effectively leverage imbalance prices for a high-quality energy recovery strategy. We trained the agent to maximize the imbalance settlement profit while ensuring conforming participation in the FCR service. The agent is also trained to keep the battery yearly cycles below a planned value. In our simulations, we demonstrated the efficacy of RL when dealing with different FCR participation magnitudes, obtaining an average improvement of +9% in profit compared to a rule-based controller baseline.},

Specifically, we employ physics-informed neural networks to learn low-dimensional, physically relevant representations that can be used with any standard RL algorithm to learn high quality control policies. Using a two-state building simulator, we show that our proposed physics-informed framework can learn high quality control policies (5-10\% improvement over business-as-usual controller) using fewer training samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Smart grids refer to electricity networks that enable a more efficient (both economical and energetic), reliable and sustainable energy production and distribution. Such networks integrate innovative tools, technologies, products and services throughout the value chain — starting from production through transmission, distribution and supply completely to the devices and installations of the consumers — by the use of monitoring, communication and control technologies. Smart grids support bidirectional real-time exchange of both energy and information. As a result the end users have access to more accurate and timely information regarding their energy consumption and to several options regarding different tariff structures, which enables demand side integration and an improvement of the energy-efficiency. To implement the new structure for sustainable energy supply on a large scale in Flanders by 2020 (and beyond), a transition is necessary with short term action points, that are however based on a mid and long term strategy. The “breakthrough” project Linear (Local Intelligent Networks and Energy Active Regions) is a first crucial step in this transition towards Smart Grids. The project focuses on the realization of a technological and implementation breakthrough by innovative technological research and a large scale pilot in a residential area. All this in close collaboration with industrial partners and associated Flemish innovation platforms. The project has a budget of 9,5 M€ for the research institutes (ESAT/Electa-KULeuven, IBBT, VITO and IMEC) during a period of 5 years starting from may 2009. Besides this, the industrial partners invest a budget of more than 32 M€. This paper presents an overview of the project, with a focus on its specific short and long term goals and objectives.},

In this paper, we investigate the potential benefits of using control mechanisms, that could be offered by a Home Energy control box, in optimizing energy consumption stemming from PHEV charging in a residential use case. We present smart energy control strategies based on quadratic programming for charging PHEVs, aiming to minimize the peak load and flatten the overall load profile. We compare two strategies, and benchmark them against a business-as-usual scenario assuming full charging starting upon plugging in the PHEV. The first, local strategy only uses information at the home where the PHEV is charged: as a result the charging is optimized for local loads. The local strategy is compared to a global iterative strategy which controls the charging of multiple vehicles based on global load information over a residential area. Both strategies control the duration and rate of charging and result in charging schedules for each vehicle. We present quantitative simulation results over a set of 150 homes, and discuss the strategies in terms of complexity and performance (esp. resulting energy consumption), as well as their requirements concerning infrastructure and communication.},

Closed solutions exist for energy management on the level of individual homes. However, no service architectures have been defined that allow the growing number of end-users to interact with the other power consumers and generators and to get involved in more rational energy consumption patterns using intuitive applications. We therefore present a common service architecture that allows houses with renewable energy generation and smart energy devices to plug into a distributed energy management system, integrated with the public power grid. Next to the technical details, we focus on the usability aspects of the end-user applications in order to contribute to high service adoption and optimal user involvement. The presented architecture facilitates end-users to reduce net energy consumption, enables power grid providers to better balance supply and demand, and allows new actors to join with new services. We present a novel simulator that allows to evaluate both the power grid and data communication aspects, and illustrate a 22\% reduction of the peak load by deploying a central coordinator inside the home gateway of an end-user.},

The demand represented by EVs can be significant, but on the other hand, sojourn times of EVs could be longer than the time required to charge their batteries to the desired level (e.g., to cover the next trip). The latter observation means that the electrical load from EVs is characterized by a certain level of flexibility, which could be exploited for example in demand response (DR) approaches (e.g., to balance generation from renewable energy sources).
This paper analyzes two data sets, one from a charging-at- home field trial in Flanders (about 8.5k charging sessions) and another from a large-scale EV public charging pole deployment in The Netherlands (more than 1M sessions). We rigorously analyze the collected data and quantify aforementioned flexibility: (1) we characterize the EV charging behavior by clustering the arrival and departure time combinations, identifying three behaviors (charging near home, charging near work, and park to charge), (2) we fit statistical models for the sojourn time, and flexibility (i.e., non-charging idle time) for each type of observed behavior, and (3) quantify the the potential of DR exploitation as the maximal load that could be achieved by coordinating EV charging for a given time of day t, continuously until t + Delta.},

For this pilot a scalable, reliable and interoperable ICT infrastructure was set up, interconnecting 245 residential power grid customers with the backend systems of energy service providers (ESPs), flexibility aggregators, distribution system operators (DSOs) and balancing responsible parties (BRPs).
On top of this architecture several business cases were rolled out, which require the sharing of metering data and flexibility information, and demand response algorithms for the balancing of renewable energy and the mitigation of voltage and power issues in distribution grids.
The goal of the pilot is the assessment of the technical and economical feasibility of residential demand response in real life, and of the interaction with the end-consumer.
In this paper we focus on the practical experiences and lessons learnt during the deployment of the ICT technology for the pilot. This includes the real-time gathering of measurement data and real-time control of a wide range of smart appliances in the homes of the participants. We identified a number of critical issues that need to be addressed for a future full-scalle roll- out: (i) reliable in-house communication, (ii) interoperability of appliances, measurement equipment, backend systems, and business cases, and (iii) sufficient backend processing power for real-time analysis and control.},

Therefore, it seems only natural to adopt circular distributions to model this data. In this paper we look into the key research question whether that leads to better generative models than using conventional linear distributions. In particular, we fit Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and a very flexible recent cylindrical (WeiSSVM) distribution mixture to real-world field trial data. Using a predictive accuracy performance measure,
we find that the latter does not provide substantially better fits. We point out shortcomings of both models and conclude that research for appropriate statistical models for the observed data is still open.},

Using RL, the DR algorithm is defined as a Markov decision process (MDP). Initial work in this area comprises algorithms to control just one EV at a time, because of scalability challenges when taking coupling between EVs into account. In this paper, we outline our idea on tackling these issues. As a first step, we propose a novel MDP definition for charging an EV fleet. More specifically, we propose (1) a relatively compact aggregate state and action space representation, and (2) a batch RL algorithm (i.e., an instance of fitted Q-iteration, FQI) to learn the optimal EV charging policy.

Conversely, in this paper, we show that the hydrogen technology can already deliver some interesting investment opportunities.

(ii) Second, we present the economic analysis. In particular, we provide assessments regarding the payback period of the installation. The results of the study let us conclude that (a) to maximize utilization, it is necessary to combine both source and storage components in a hybrid topology, and that (b) in the best scenario, PV co-exists with wind power achieving 65.5% utilization and delivering a payback period in less than 6 years, when hydrogen is sold at at least 6 euro/kg.},

  abstract        = {Over time, photovoltaic (PV) systems become increasingly susceptible to faults. Early fault detection and identification not only limits power losses and increases the systems lifetime, but also prevents more serious consequences, such as risk of fire or electrical shock. Although several accurate fault diagnosis methods have been proposed in literature, most PV systems remain unmonitored as the installations are not equipped with the required sensors. In this work, we propose a fault diagnosis technique that does not require on-site sensors. Rather, weather satellite and inverter measurements are used as inputs for the proposed machine learning model. As no dedicated sensors are needed, our method is widely applicable and cost-effective. A temporal convolutional neural network is developed to accurately identify 6 common types of faults, based on the past 24 h of measurements. The proposed approach is tested extensively on a simulated PV system, taking into account multiple severities of each fault type, and reaches an accuracy of over 86%.},

  abstract        = {A continuous rise in the penetration of renewable energy sources, along with the use of the single imbalance pricing, provides a new opportunity for balance responsible parties to reduce their cost through energy arbitrage in the imbalance settlement mechanism. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods are an appropriate choice for solving the energy arbitrage problem due to their outstanding performance in solving complex stochastic sequential problems. However, RL is rarely deployed in real-world applications since its learned policy does not necessarily guarantee safety during the execution phase. In this paper, we propose a new RL-based control framework for batteries to obtain a safe energy arbitrage strategy in the imbalance settlement mechanism. In our proposed control framework, the agent initially aims to optimize the arbitrage revenue. Subsequently, in the post-processing step, we correct (constrain) the learned policy following a knowledge distillation process based on properties that follow human intuition. Our post-processing step is a generic method and is not restricted to the energy arbitrage domain. We use the Belgian imbalance price of 2023 to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework. Furthermore, we deploy our proposed control framework on a real battery to show its capability in the real world.},

  abstract        = {Demand-side flexibility is gaining importance as a crucial element in the energy transition process. Accounting for about 25% of final energy consumption globally, the residential sector is an important (potential) source of energy flexibility. However, unlocking this flexibility requires developing a control framework that (1) easily scales across different houses, (2) is easy to maintain, and (3) is simple to understand for end-users. A potential control framework for such a task is data-driven control, specifically model-free reinforcement learning (RL). Such RL-based controllers learn a good control policy by interacting with their environment, learning purely based on data and with minimal human intervention. Yet, they lack explainability, which hampers user acceptance. Moreover, limited hardware capabilities of residential assets forms a hurdle (e.g., using deep neural networks). To overcome both those challenges, we propose a novel method to obtain explainable RL policies by using differentiable decision trees. Using a policy distillation approach, we train these differentiable decision trees to mimic standard RL-based controllers, leading to a decision tree-based control policy that is data-driven and easy to explain. As a proof-of-concept, we examine the performance and explainability of our proposed approach in a battery-based home energy management system to reduce energy costs. For this use case, we show that our proposed approach can outperform baseline rule-based policies by about 20-25%, while providing simple, explainable control policies. We further compare these explainable policies with standard RL policies and examine the performance trade-offs associated with this increased explainability.},

Through tax/VAT reductions and free additional services — such as free parking, and/or battery charging or lower traffic congestion taxes — private users, public organizations and car fleet operators are stimulated to adopt the plug-in (hybrid) electrical vehicle (PHEV). This upcoming breakthrough of PHEVs will impose various challenges to the power grid, such as a significant increase of the load in residential areas and parking spaces as the limited range requires frequent charging. Another challenge is the seamless driver and car identification and fraud-sensitive measuring of the charged energy anywhere a car is charged. On the other hand new opportunities are created as these vehicles allow the storage of power on a wide scale, and typically offer some flexibility during the charging process which can be exploited by smart charging services to balance demand and supply or maximize the local consumption of renewable energy. In this paper we discuss the main actors involved in the charging of leased cars in public parking spaces. We present a novel service architecture and detail the security aspects. Furthermore we discuss how a market-based smart charging algorithm that is plugged into the architecture can exploit the flexibility of the parked cars to maximize the consumption of local generated wind energy. We conclude this paper with the presentation of a new business model for the smart charging of leased cars in public parking spaces, detailing the different actors and value flows.},

We present a distributed algorithm that minimizes imbalance costs, and the disutility experienced by consumers. Our approach is very much practical, as it respects privacy, while still obtaining near-optimal solutions, by limiting the information exchanged: i.e. consumers do not share their preferences, deadlines, etc. Coordination is achieved through the exchange of virtual prices associated with energy consumption at certain times.
We evaluate our approach in a case study comprising 100 electric vehicles over the course of 4 weeks, where renewable energy is supplied by a small scale wind turbine. Simulation results show that 68% of energy demand can be supplied by wind energy using our distributed algorithm, compared to 73% in a
theoretical optimum scenario, and only 40% in an uncoordinated business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Also, the increased usage of renewable energy sources, i.e. wind power, results in a 45% reduction of CO2 emissions, using our distributed algorithm.},

Adequately dealing with such PHEVs is one of the challenges and opportunities for smart grids. In particular, intelligent control strategies for the charging process can significantly alleviate peak load increases that are to be expected from e.g. residential vehicle charging at home. In addition, the car batteries connected to the grid can also be exploited to deliver grid services, and in particular give stored energy back to the grid to help coping with peak demands stemming from e.g. household appliances. In this paper, we will address such so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scenarios while considering the optimization of PHEV charging in a residential scenario. In particular, we will assess the optimal car battery (dis)charging scheduling to achieve peak shaving and reduction of the variability (over time) of the load of households connected to a local distribution grid. We compare (i) a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, without any intelligent charging, (ii) intelligent local charging optimization without V2G, and (iii) charging optimization with V2G. To evaluate these scenarios, we make use of our simulation tool, based on OMNeT++, which combines ICT and power network models and incorporates a Matlab model that allows e.g. assessing voltage violations. In a case study on a three- feeder distribution network spanning 63 households, we observe that non-V2G optimized charging can reduce the peak demand compared to BAU with 64\%. If we apply V2G to the intelligent charging, we can further cut the non-V2G peak demand with 17\% (i.e., achieve a peak load which is only 30\% of BAU).},

In this paper, we propose an innovative integrated framework that models and simulates both the communication network and power networks. We discuss the design and operation of the simulation environment, and illustrate this by means of a case study that employs it.},

The current solution to this problem comprises automatically switching off some of the local generators resulting in a loss of green energy. In this paper we study the impact of different solar panel penetration levels in an residential area and the corresponding effects on the distribution feeder line. To mitigate these problems, we assess how effective it is to locally store excess energy in batteries. A case study on a residential feeder serving 63 houses shows that if 80\% of them have photo-voltaic (PV) panels, 45\% of them will be switched off, resulting in 482 kWh of PV-generated energy being lost. We show that providing a 9 kWh battery at each house can mitigate some voltage violations, and therefor allowing for more renewable energy to be used.},

  abstract        = {Keeping the balance between electricity generation and consumption is becoming increasingly challenging and costly due to the growing integration of renewables, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and the electrification of industrial processes. Accurate imbalance forecasts, along with reliable uncertainty estimations, enable transmission system operators (TSOs) to dispatch appropriate reserve volumes, reducing balancing costs. Further, market parties can use these probabilistic forecasts to design strategies that leverage asset flexibility for grid balancing, generating revenue with known risks. Despite its importance, system imbalance (SI) forecasting has not been widely studied in the literature. Further, existing methods do not focus on situations with high imbalance magnitudes, which are crucial to forecast accurately for both TSOs and market parties. Hence, we propose an ensemble of constant variable selection networks (C-VSNs), which are a novel adaptation of VSNs. Each minute, our model predicts the imbalance of the current and upcoming two quarter-hours, along with uncertainty estimations for these forecasts. We evaluate our approach by forecasting the imbalance of Belgium, where high imbalance magnitude is defined as SI MW (occurs 1.3/% of the time in Belgium). Results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed C-VSN model improves probabilistic forecast performance by 23.4 % in high imbalance magnitude situations and 6.5 % overall, as measured by the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). Similar improvements are observed for root-mean-squared error (RMSE). Additionally, we introduce a novel fine-tuning methodology that effectively integrates new inputs with limited historical data. This work was performed in collaboration with the Belgian TSO Elia to further improve their imbalance forecasts, demonstrating the relevance of our work.},

  abstract        = {The growing reliance on renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, has introduced challenges due to their uncontrollable production. This complicates maintaining the electrical grid balance, prompting some transmission system operators in Western Europe to implement imbalance tariffs that penalize unsustainable power deviations. These tariffs create an implicit demand response framework to mitigate grid instability. Yet, several challenges limit active participation. In Belgium, for example, imbalance prices are only calculated at the end of each 15-minute settlement period, creating high risk due to price uncertainty. This risk is further amplified by the inherent volatility of imbalance prices, discouraging participation. Although transmission system operators provide minute-based price predictions, the system imbalance volatility makes accurate price predictions challenging to obtain and requires sophisticated techniques. Moreover, publishing price estimates can prompt participants to adjust their schedules, potentially affecting the system balance and the final price, adding further complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search method that publishes accurate imbalance prices while accounting for potential response actions. Our approach models the system dynamics using a neural network forecaster and a cluster of virtual batteries controlled by reinforcement learning agents. Compared to Belgium’s current publication method, our technique improves price accuracy by 20.4 % under ideal conditions and by 12.8 % in more realistic scenarios. This research addresses an unexplored, yet crucial problem, positioning this paper as a pioneering work in analyzing the potential of more advanced imbalance price publishing techniques.},

However, their adoption by energy management companies remains limited due to the black-box nature of DRL, which fails to provide transparent decision-making feedback. To address this, explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) techniques have emerged, aiming to make DRL decisions more transparent. Among these, soft differential decision tree (DDT) distillation provides a promising approach due to the clear decision rules they are based on, which can be efficiently computed. However, achieving high performance often requires deep, and completely full, trees, which reduces interpretability. To overcome this, we propose a novel asymmetric soft DDT construction method. Unlike traditional soft DDTs, our approach adaptively constructs trees by expanding nodes only when necessary. This improves the efficient use of decision nodes, which require a predetermined depth to construct full symmetric trees, enhancing both interpretability and performance. We demonstrate the potential of asymmetric DDTs to provide transparent, efficient, and high-performing decision-making in home energy management systems.},

  abstract        = {Adopting renewable energy sources (RES) can pave the way toward reaching net-zero carbon emissions. However, the intermittent nature of RES can pose significant challenges to balance responsible parties (BRPs) and transmission system operators (TSOs) in maintaining the balance of the electricity grid. BRPs can assist TSOs in balancing the grid by occasionally deviating from their nomination to help reduce the system imbalance, which is called implicit balancing. In this paper, we propose data-driven implicit balancing strategies for BRPs in the Dutch imbalance settlement mechanism. Dutch implicit balancing is challenging due to the Dutch imbalance pricing calculation, which is a combination of single and dual pricing methods. To cope with this challenge, a risk management perspective is incorporated into the proposed method through distributional reinforcement learning. Distributional reinforcement learning agents are trained to manage a BRP's battery in the presence of wind farm generation stochasticity to reduce its imbalance cost. Dutch imbalance data of 2024 are used to assess the performance of the learned implicit strategies. The proposed method is benchmarked against deterministic model predictive control and a rule-based controller. The results show that both risk-neutral and risk-averse agents improve daily profit by 29.3% and 20.7% respectively, compared to the rule-based controller. Moreover, the risk-averse agent decreases the average portfolio deviation during dual pricing situations by 19.2% compared to the risk-neutral agent, resulting in a lower imbalance cost for the BRP in these situations.},

  abstract        = {The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into electrical grids has disrupted the balance between production and consumption. To address this challenges, transmission system operators such as the Belgian one have introduced imbalance tariffs that penalize harmful energy deviations. Although the imbalance settlement mechanism allows balance responsible parties to dynamically adjust their energy positions, it also exposes them to significant risks. In fact, Belgian imbalance prices are determined retrospectively at the end of each settlement block, meaning that energy deviations occur under uncertain pricing conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution for navigating this uncertainty thanks to its ability to manage stochastic environments and deliver long-term rewards. However, achieving profitable participation in imbalance settlement requires more than just handling price volatility; it also demands a deep understanding of the grid dynamics. This paper examines how enriching an RL agent's observation space with grid-related data can enhance its awareness of system dynamics and improve decision-making. We specifically focus on the agent's performance during unstable periods -- i.e., quarters where last-minute deviations in system imbalance heavily influence prices -- by introducing a related metric. Using the soft actor-critic algorithm, we control a simulated battery energy storage system participating in the Belgian imbalance settlement, leveraging historical data spanning three years. Our findings indicate that, compared to a system-agnostic RL agent (i.e., an agent that does not have grid-related values in the observation space), the system-aware agents develop more effective policies, particularly during unstable quarters.},
